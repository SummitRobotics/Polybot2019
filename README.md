## Roadmap

* Begin some basic housekeeping :white_check_mark:
* Create helper methods for common tasks (This one is important to get done before the season starts) :no_entry:
* Improve dead reckoning movement (This has been redone every year for the past 4 years. Why stop now) :no_entry:
* Define .robot standard :no_entry:
* Implement .robot decoder :no_entry:
